    '''Given two strings str1 and str2, prints all interleavings of the given
    two strings. You may assume that all characters in both strings are
    different.
    Example 1:
    Input: str1 = "AB", str2 = "CD"
    Output:
    ABCD
    ACBD
    ACDB
    CABD
    CADB

    # Third program idea

    # Fourth program idea
    ''' Given an m x n matrix mat, return an array of all the elements of the
    matrix in diagonal order. Ensure the function handles edge cases, such as
    when the matrix is empty or has only one row or column.
    Example 1:
    Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
    Output: [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]

    Example 2:
    Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]]
    Output: [1,2,3,4] '''

    # Fifth program idea
    ''' Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become
    goal after some number of shifts on s.
    A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the
    rightmost position.
    For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
    Example 1:
    Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
    Output: true
    Example 2:
    Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
    Output: false
    Constraints:
    1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100
    s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.''',
