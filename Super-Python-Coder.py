    # Fourth program idea
    ''' Given an m x n matrix mat, return an array of all the elements of the
    array in a diagonal order.
    Example 1:
    Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
    Output: [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]

    of its digits and the sum of its digits.
    Example 1:

    Explanation:
    Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
